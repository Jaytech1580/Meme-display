# Meme-display
This is a challenge from a freecodecamp course I took and has been by me solved with guidance and lot of research(of course! as a learner).
The goal of the challenge was to complete the index.html and script.js files using JAVASCRIPT DOM to make the application display meme, qoutes, jokes or riddle with a solution not simultaneously but one at a time onClick of a button. 
I was provided guidance by @zg_dev (ZachGoll).
Nevertheless, I'm glad I learnt from it and I hope you do too....
